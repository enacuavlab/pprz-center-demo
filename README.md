# pprz-center-demo

Welcome in the model of what could be the future Paparazzi Center HMI !

1) To run that model, you need :

-> Python 3.4 (install package 'python3')
-> PyQt5 (install package 'python3-pyqt5')

Then, launch the program in a terminal ('python3 main.py')


2) About that model :

-> It's a pure HMI model, no function is implemented yet.
-> The widgets are set to give the clearest idea about their role in the HMI.
-> You can explore the pages and get iformations about the components by their tooltips.


3) Feedback :

I'm an intern student at the ENAC and my mission is to reconceive the Paparazzi Center in Python/Qt to make it more intuitive and 'maintainable' (that can evolve easily).

So I would like to have your feeling about this first proposition :).

If you have any question or comment about that model, please contact me by Github (my pseudo is 'floienac' and I use Gitter) or by mail ('f.bitard@gmail.com'), I'd be glad to be criticized, especially if you're directly concerned as a user or a developper of Paparazzi UAV.

Thanks by advance.
